							<p class="article__paragraph">There have been a few more things I have done to wrap up phase one. First, Validating my html.
								<a class="link" href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup Validation Service</a> is the best place to go. There are three ways
								to validate: by URI, file upload, or direct input (copy and paste). You can have it display your source to indicate
								exactly where you may have issues, you can also have it produce an image report and outline. This will assist you
								in following W3C's intended purpose for html and the standard for which they have laid forth. You may be asking why
								do this? <em>Semantic html</em>. Here are a couple quotes from
								<a class="link" href="http://vanseodesign.com/web-design/semantic-html/">vanseodesign.com</a>
							</p>
							<blockquote class="article__blockquote" cite="http://vanseodesign.com/web-design/semantic-html/">
								When people say they want to make something more semantic, they simply want to make that thing more meaningful.
							</blockquote>
							<p class="article__paragraph">What does semantics mean anyway?</p>
							<blockquote class="article__blockquote">
							<dl class="definition-list">
								<dt>
									<dfn class="definition-list__term">
										semantics (adj.)
									</dfn>
								</dt>
								<dd class="definition-list__definition">of or relating to meaning, especially in language;</dd>
								<dd class="definition-list__definition">the meaning or relationship of meanings of a sign or set of signs</dd>
							</dl>
							</blockquote>
							<p class="article__paragraph">So, then the next logical question is, What is semantic html?</p>
							<blockquote class="article__blockquote" cite="http://vanseodesign.com/web-design/semantic-html/">
								Semantic html is using html to reinforce structural meaning. It’s about using tags, class names, and ids that reinforce the
								meaning of the content within the tags.
								<br />
								<br /> Semantic html is also about using tags in the right way.
							</blockquote>
							<p class="article__paragraph">The article linked above goes into great detail into why semantic html is important, please have a read.</p>
							<p class="article__paragraph">
								Second, I did some <a class="link" href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/responsive-typography/table-of-contents">Pluralsight</a>								video watching regarding typography. I won't go into the details but choosing and sizing typography is quite important
								and has a lot of ramifications. I suggest checking out this video if you have Pluralsight access. After watching
								some of this I updated my fonts to use webfonts, and made sizing adjustments for mobile. One thing to note about
								webfonts, it helps guarantee your sight will have the same type face across devices and platforms. You should be
								careful though not to bog down your site with large font files.
							</p>
							<blockquote class="article__blockquote" cite="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/responsive-typography/transcript"
							 author="Jason Pamental">
								Typography is Fred Astaire. Web typography is Ginger Rogers that has to do everything Fred does backwards and in heels. Web
								is different. It's harder. You have more things to think about and rather than just the aesthetics or the communication
								and trying to get somebody to do something, you have to deal with technically how do you make that happen across
								all these devices and access speeds and input technologies and the operating systems and browsers themselves.

							<p class="article__paragraph">
								The previous "<a class="link" href="#article-1">Creating This Website</a>" article was my first blog and I feel it went pretty
								well. I think the primary take away is that a blog is really just writing an article/journal entry. Neither of which
								I have any formal training or education in. Other than a writing 101 course in college 15 years ago. I didn't exactly
								follow the rough outline that I laid out in that article. Primarily I left out most of the technical details. So,
								in this article I'll attempt to do just that.
							</p>
							<p class="article__paragraph">
								First off, what is front-end development? Here is the definition from
								<a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development">wikipedia.org</a> that sums it up well:
							</p>
							<blockquote class="article__blockquote" cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development">
								Front-end web development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that
								a user can see and interact with them directly.
							</blockquote>
							<p class="article__paragraph">
								Another great quote from
								<a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development">wikipedia.org</a> which is so true:
							</p>
							<blockquote class="article__blockquote" cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development">
								The challenge associated with front-end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website
								change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.
							</blockquote>
							<p class="article__paragraph">
								You quickly realize this is so very true as soon as you begin your adventure into front-end development. A key lesson to
								learn very early is to <em>never</em> stop learning. Here are the sights I have used to learn:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<a class="link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">developer.mozilla.org</a> <i></i>

								</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="article__paragraph">
								For this particular site I started with the basic building blocks of a webpage, html and css. No JavaScript has been written
								for this site as of today. Actually, this is my third personal site that I've created. My first is no longer around.
								I wrote back in the early 2000's, although I probably could find the code. My <a class="link" href="../about/index1.html">second site</a>								is still around and this one I also built with only html and css. I was going to add some JavaScript but never did.
							</p>
							<p class="article__paragraph">
								Of the three foundational components of a website html is the first component and truly the only required piece. You could
								get away without using any css and quite easily get away without JavaScript. HTML5 introduced more elements that
								help make it easier to focus on meaningful html, that is no presentational aspects in the html only structure, semantic
								html. Presentation is the job of css.
							</p>
							<p class="article__paragraph">
								I focused on html and worked on structuring a well formed documents with semantic. Learning about document flow and how elements
								relate to one another is very helpful once you start using css to move things around.
							</p>
							<p class="article__paragraph">
								Then came the css to present the document in a visually appealing way. These pages use the new flex box, well probably not
								so new any longer. I find flex box quite nice for responsive design. Much easier than floating everything with auto
								margins and fixed page widths. Flex box is used to position elements in order to affect document flow and layout.
								The second main purpose beside layout that css is used for is design or presentation or what I like to call it is,
								"make it pretty". So, things like font size, type, color. Images, borders, anything really visual.
							</p>
							<p class="article__paragraph">
								During this process of using only html and css I've learn a lot. Just html and css and <em>really</em> knowing them
								is a lot. I find myself thinking, "wow it would be so nice to be using JavaScript and a library like React.js." I
								say this because for my job I've been writing a lot of React code and find component based pages much nicer for reusability.
								I find myself duplicating a lot of html that could be written as one component that gets used on many pages.
							</p>
							<p class="article__paragraph">
								I'm at the point where I am happy with the html and css and where this site is with only those two technologies. So, next
								up I plan to re-write this site with React.js. I will keep this one as is html and css only so I can have a side
								by side comparison both of code and performance. I know already using React will improve page to page navigation
								since it will be a Single Page App.
							</p>
							<p class="article__paragraph">
								More to come on React and the consequences of choosing a library like React as opposed to sticking with vanilla JavaScript,
								html and css...

								So, I've never written a blog post before. Not here not anywhere. I have a list of topics I should be writing about at work.
								All front-end related. Other priorities get in the way...at least that's what I tell myself. I've never been a person
								that journaled much or at all. I tried once as a kid. One summer we were planning a big vacation, I had just received
								a really cool corduroy covered journal and I was determined as ever to journal my experiences that summer... I think
								all I got in that thing was, "Today we are off, vacation has finally started". Yep that's about it.
							</p>
							<p class="article__paragraph">
								I love technology, maybe starting a Blog is the way to start putting thoughts and experiences down on "paper". Well, here's
								to what may be the start of something great, or not.
							</p>
							<p class="article__paragraph">
								Enough gibberish, let's get started. I want to talk about this website in particular and how I got started. What I have used
								to learn and what i have used to create this site. Also, where I'm headed and the journey that never ends in an ever
								evolving Front-end Eco-system.
							</p>
							<p class="article__paragraph">
								I've always dabbled a bit here and there with FED (Front-End Development) since the late 90's and have been pretty good at
								the basics. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery. Learned enough to get by for the job. I never really got too serious until
								2012 when I took on a major project to convert 4 major applications that targeted one browser, IE, and make them
								compatible with multiple browsers. Wow, was that a lot of work. Since then I have learned an enormous amount yet
								still find there is so much more to learn. Once you learn something in FED some new thing comes out. I love it though,
								keeps me on my toes and forces me to learn continuously.
							</p>
							<p class="article__paragraph">
								For this page specifically, I've gone into it as if I knew nothing. I've read numerous articles, blogs, watched several training
								videos. Learned a great deal more and began this site with the bare bone basics, HTML and CSS. At this point all
								I have is exactly that. Some of what I learned recently and applied here is some HTML5 and trying to keep with semantic
								HTML and regarding the CSS I used Flex-box for a responsive site.
							</p>
							<p class="article__paragraph">
								I have 4 pages that i have been coding with a basic routing structure using a typical directory structure that each loads
								an index.html. While developing locally I have been manually refreshing the index.html file and when navigating I
								have been hitting the directory since my route is relative. Therefore I have to click on the index.html file to get
								navigated there. This is quite annoying, so I will be adding http-server to serve my base directory. This will allow
								me to get routed properly when using the navigation menu locally. Next step after that is possibly use some hot reloading
								tool...not sure if that is necessary. I do plan to convert this site to React.js.
