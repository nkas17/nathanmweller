											<h3 class="item">Creating This Website - More Technical</h3>
											<h6 class="item">Sept 14, 2017 ~ nathan m weller</h6>
										</header>
										<p>
											The previous  "<a href="#article-1">Creating This Website</a>" article was my first blog and 
											I feel it went pretty well.  
											I think the primary take away is that a blog is really just writing 
											an article/journal entry.  Neither of which I have any formal training or education in.  
											Other than a writing 101 course in college 15 years ago.    
											I didn't exactly follow the rough outline that I laid out in that article.
											Primarily I left out most of the 
											technical details.  So, in this article I'll attempt to do just that.  
										</p>
										<p>
											First off, what is front-end development?  Here is the definition from 
											<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development">wikipedia.org</a> that sums it up well:
										</p>
										<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development">
											Front-end web development is the practice of producing HTML, 
											CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user 
											can see and interact with them directly.
										</blockquote>
										<p>
											Another great quote from 
											<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development">wikipedia.org</a> which is so true:
										</p>
										<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development">
												The challenge associated with front-end development is that the tools and 
												techniques used to create the front end of a website change 
												constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.
										</blockquote>
										<p>
											You quickly realize this is so very true as soon as you begin your adventure into 
											front-end development.  A key lesson to learn very early is to <em>never</em> stop 
											learning.  Here are the sights I have used to learn:
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">developer.mozilla.org</a> <i></i>
											</li>
											<li>
												<a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/">pluralsight.com</a> <i></i>
											</li>
											<li>
												<a href="https://www.codeschool.com/">codeschool.com</a> <i></i>
											</li>
											<li>
												<a href="https://egghead.io/">egghead.io</a>
											</li>
										</ul>
										<p>
											For this particular site I started with the basic building blocks of a webpage, html and css. 
											No JavaScript has been written for this site as of today.  Actually, this is my third personal site
											that I've created.  My first is no longer around.  I wrote back in the early 2000's, 
											although I probably could find the code.  My <a href="../about/index1.html">second site</a> 
											is still around and this one I also built with
											only html and css.  I was going to add some JavaScript but never did.
										</p>
										<p>
											Of the three foundational components of a website html is the first component and truly the only required piece. 
											You could get away without using any css and quite easily get away without JavaScript.  HTML5 introduced more elements
											that help make it easier to focus on meaningful html, that is no presentational aspects in the html only structure, semantic html.
											Presentation is the job of css.
										</p>
										<p>
											I focused on html and worked on structuring a well formed documents with semantic.  
											Learning about document flow and how elements relate to one another is very helpful 
											once you start using css to move things around.
										</p>
										<p>
											Then came the css to present the document in a visually appealing way.  These pages use the new flex box, 
											well probably not so new any longer.
											I find flex box quite nice for responsive design.  Much easier than floating everything with auto margins and fixed page widths.
											Flex box is used to position elements in order to affect document flow and layout.  The second main purpose beside layout that 
											css is used for is design or presentation or what I like to call it is, "make it pretty".  So, things like font size,
											type, color.  Images, borders, anything really visual.  
										</p>
										<p>
											During this process of using only html and css I've learn a lot.  Just html and css and <em>really</em> knowing them is
											a lot.  I find myself thinking, "wow it would be 
											so nice to be using JavaScript and a library like React.js."  I say this because for my job I've been writing a lot of React
											code and find component based pages much nicer for reusability.  I find myself duplicating a lot of html that could be 
											written as one component that gets used on many pages. 
										</p>
										<p>
											I'm at the point where I am happy with the html and css and where this site is with only those two technologies.  So, 
											next up I plan to re-write this site with React.js.  I will keep this one as is html and css only so I can have a side by
											side comparison both of code and performance.  I know already using React will improve page to page navigation 
											since it will be a Single Page App.
										</p>
										<p>
											More to come on React and the consequences of choosing a library like React as opposed to sticking with vanilla JavaScript, html and css...

											So, I've never written a blog post before. Not here not anywhere.  
											I have a list of topics I should be writing about at work.  All front-end related.  
											Other priorities get in the way...at least that's what I tell myself.  
											I've never been a person that journaled much or at all.  I tried once as a kid.  
											One summer we were planning a big vacation, I had just received a really cool corduroy covered 
											journal and I was determined as ever to journal my experiences that summer...
											I think all I got in that thing was, "Today we are off, vacation has finally started".  Yep that's about it.
										</p>
										<p>
											I love technology, maybe starting a Blog is the way to start putting thoughts and experiences down on "paper".  
											Well, here's to what may be the start of something great, or not.
										</p>
										<p>
											Enough gibberish, let's get started.  I want to talk about this website in particular and how I got started.  
											What I have used to learn and what i have used to create this site.
											Also, where I'm headed and the journey that never ends in an ever evolving Front-end Eco-system.
										</p>
										<p>
											I've always dabbled a bit here and there with FED (Front-End Development) since the late 90's and have been pretty good at the basics.  
											HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery.  Learned enough to get by for the job.  I never really got too serious until 2012 when
											I took on a major project to convert 4 major applications that targeted one browser, IE, and make them compatible with multiple
											browsers.  Wow, was that a lot of work.  Since then I have learned an enormous amount yet still find there is so much more to learn.
											Once you learn something in FED some new thing comes out.  I love it though, keeps me on my toes and forces me to learn continuously.
										</p>
										<p>
											For this page specifically, I've gone into it as if I knew nothing.  I've read numerous articles, blogs, watched several training videos. 
											Learned a great deal more and began this site with the bare bone basics, HTML and CSS.  At this point all I have is exactly that.  
											Some of what I learned recently and applied here is some HTML5 and trying to keep with semantic HTML and regarding the CSS I used Flex-box for 
											a responsive site.  
										</p>
										<p>
											I have 4 pages that i have been coding with a basic routing structure using a typical directory structure that each loads an index.html.  While developing locally
											I have been manually refreshing the index.html file and when navigating I have been hitting the directory since my route is relative.  
											Therefore I have to click on the index.html file to get navigated there.  This is quite annoying, so I will be adding http-server to serve my base directory.  
											This will allow me to get routed properly when using the navigation menu locally.  Next step after that is possibly use some hot reloading tool...not sure if that is necessary.
											I do plan to convert this site to React.js.
