								Jumping head first into <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> is more than I ever realized.   
								It's just a JavaScript (<abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr>) library.  A small one at that, especially
								compared to it's competitor, <a href="https://angularjs.org">Angular</a>.  <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> is less than 200k, 
								<a href="https://angularjs.org">Angular</a> over 500k, both minified sizes.  Therefore
								it must be simple…not exactly…Point being there is far more to learn than a small library even if you are an expert
								JavaScripter.  If you've never worked with "building" a single page application then you have a lot to learn.  For starters,
								there's the library/framework to learn.  Granted the authors of these have starter kits that make getting started
								very simple.  However, if you are like me and crave the need to know "How Things Work" you soon find there is A Lot
								that makes a good single page application get built and work well.  
								<!-- Here are a few logos of just some of the choices
								you have when learning "How Things Work". -->
							</p>
							<!-- <figure>
								<figcaption>[IMAGE-of slide of logos]</figcaption>
							</figure> -->
							<p>
								What I'd like to do with this series is take you on a little journey.  I'd like to give you an idea of what I've gone through
								to learn <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> and what has ultimately become learning "All Things Front-End".  
								Well it wont be quite All the things,
								there are just too many… but I will cover the pieces required to ensure you will have a sound and solid single page
								application built with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> and what I used for all the pieces.
							</p>
							<p>
								My previous posts go into some rough detail about creating a website with 4 pages ( home, front-end development, blog, and
								about).  This was done with only the classic Front-end techs, <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr>.  That's right no <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr>.  So, if you even
								have a little <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> experience then you'll be ahead, but not much.  If you've never used <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> then you have even more
								to learn.  But don’t get discouraged, like I said even the seasoned JavaScripter will have a lot to learn if they've never
								worked on a new single page app tech stack.  And let's be real, if you do anything Front-End you are having to constantly
								learn and learn some more.
							</p>
							<p>
								So, going from only needing to know 2 technologies to create a 4 page website we are about to move on to learning [number
								of logos from slides], and there are so many more you could choose from and learn.  Has my point been driven home
								yet?  The Front-End is far more complex than it has ever been.  There is a greater need for highly skilled developers
								to build these single page applications.  No longer can we depend on our back-end developers to slap a little <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr>
								in their <abbr title="Java Server Pages">JSP</abbr>s to make the Front-end do what they want.  Keep in mind though, 
								if you are building websites for clients
								depending on their needs you very well could get away with just <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr>.  However, if your client has other
								needs then the benefits of a single page application could set them up for success, and you.  Start simple then add
								the complexity if and when it is required.  Don’t start with over engineering a site, that will be more difficult
								to maintain.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now that I've completed my tangent regarding the complexities our new Front-End single page apps require let's get started!
							</p>
							<p>
								First and foremost you need <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>.  You can download this for free, and by the way, everything required
								to build a single page application is completely free.  What is <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>?  I'm glad you asked. 
							</p>
							<blockquote cite="https://nodejs.org/en/">
								Node.js® is a JavaScript
								runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it
								lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in
								the world. 
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								So, what in the world does that mean…basically it's what makes the <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> world go round.  Without it things
								would not be nearly as easy.  Packaged within <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> is 
								<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/is"><abbr title="Node Package Manager">NPM</abbr></a> 
								which is Node Package Manager, you will become very
								familiar with this.  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/is"><abbr title="Node Package Manager">NPM</abbr></a> 
								 is used to retrieve the hundreds of <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> packages that others have
								created and kindly shared with the world.  
							</p>
							<blockquote cite="https://www.npmjs.com/is">
								npm is the package manager for JavaScript and the world’s largest software
								registry. Discover packages of reusable code — and assemble them in powerful new ways. 
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								Why solve problems that others
								have solved, use and learn from others.  Don’t forget to give back when you can too.  It's what makes the 
								<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/is"><abbr title="Node Package Manager">NPM</abbr></a>  ecosystem
								so amazing.  Now that we have <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> and 
								<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/is"><abbr title="Node Package Manager">NPM</abbr></a>  we can really get started.  
								Oh, one other thing required is something
								to edit files in.  You probably already have one, even if it's just notepad, that works.  However, a few that are
								tailored for front-end development are <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com"><abbr title="Visual Studio Code">VSCode</abbr></a>, 
								<a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a>, <a href="http://brackets.io">Brackets</a>, <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime</a> and many others.  
								Personally I like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com"><abbr title="Visual Studio Code">VSCode</abbr></a>.
								There is a very active development team maintaining it and making improvements all the time.  IT's easy to add extensions
								and there are a lot already built.  Like I said everything you need is free and there is no exception here.  Now
								that we have a code editor and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> we can begin!  Join me again soon for next steps, 
								getting started with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>
								- setting up our development environment.
